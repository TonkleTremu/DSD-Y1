# dsd-y1
A collection of (mostly) Python files, which exist because of my DSD college course.
There's almost certainly no reason to be here, unless you'd like to cheat on your DSD course, or if you're my college teacher for programming.
Also, for literally no reason at all, I've accidentally attached the college's desktop background, so if anyone wants that, feel free to just find it.
