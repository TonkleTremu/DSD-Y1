listA = [1, 2, 3] # An integer-exclusive array.
listB = [1, "2", 3.0] # A mixed data type list.

# Python treats mixed-type lists almost identical to normal lists.
# Traditional arrays would not allow for mixed data types, and would also not allow for the array to increase in size.
# Lists are useful for real-world data, since it would likely be constantly increasing, so a fixed array size would not be helpful, and also real-world data may be using many different data types, so a list would be necessary for it.
